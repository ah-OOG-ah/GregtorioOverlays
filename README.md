# Gregtorio Overlays
Adds Factorio-style overlays to GT5u-1.7.10, using VisualProspecting's API.

## TODO:
 - Add two modes to future pollution cache: a universal one, gated by a satellite, and one updated by hand/machine available pre-Ev
 - Run a profiler to make sure that this isn't a resource hog

## Libraries/Dependecies
GT5u from GTNH, for the pollution.
Journeymap for the map.
VisualProspecting for the map-editing API.
GTNHLib for the config system and bundled fastutil.
Unimixins for... mixins.
Boilerplate, build script, and GitHub workflows from GTNH's fork of SinTh0r4s' ExampleMod, both under the MIT license.
