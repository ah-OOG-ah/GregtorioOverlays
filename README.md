# Gregtorio Overlays
Adds Factorio-style overlays to GT5u-1.7.10, using VisualProspecting's API.

## TODO:
 - Implement proper client-side cache and network code, so this functions on a dedicated server + client.
 - Add two modes to future pollution cache: a universal one, gated by a satellite, and one updated by hand/machine available pre-Ev
 - Run a profiler to make sure that this isn't a resource hog
 - Add a config file.

## Libraries
Boilerplate, build script, and GitHub workflows from GTNH's fork of SinTh0r4s' ExampleMod, both under the MIT license.
