# Gregtorio Overlays
Adds Factorio-style overlays to GT5u-1.7.10, using VisualProspecting's API.

## TODO:
 - Add two modes to future pollution cache: a universal one, gated by a satellite, and one updated by hand/machine available pre-Ev
 - Run a profiler to make sure that this isn't a resource hog

## Libraries/Dependecies
- GT5u from GTNH, for the pollution. This is actually an optional dependency now, feel free to PR additional backends
- Journeymap for the map.
- Navigator for the map-editing API.
- GTNHLib for the config system and bundled fastutil.
- Unimixins for... mixins.

## Other credits
Because mcmod.info doesn't wrap lines
 - The GTNH team and many others, for the boilerplate code and a working toolchain.
